The Perl6 weekly is back in force, Reini found out an itsy bitsy little thing that, once tweaked, improved the speed of the Perl 5 core testing by a lot, and, uh, I might have full mad scientist while  nobody was looking. So, pour yourself a nice exotic drink, bring the tablet/phone/laptop outside, and enjoy both your PerlWeekly and some of the Sun's warmth! ~ `/anick"
