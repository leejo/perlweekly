      " Yesterday was CPAN day: the 20th(!) anniversary of the day CPAN appeared online. A few articles of this week's edition celebrate the event, and promote the kind of interaction that keeps it alive. Which is wonderful, it really is. But for me the greatest articles of this week are the two that go beyond the code and talk about the community behind it. Not because our community is perfect, far from it, nor because it's without its problems, but because we do a few things right. Like hugs. We do hugs really well. And, frankly, if a community gets that right, it got the architectural thing all figured out; the rest is merely implemention details. Enjoy! ~ `/anick"
